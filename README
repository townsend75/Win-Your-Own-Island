## Features:

The site consists of three pages. All three pages contain the same header and footer, listing the name of the business, three menu buttons and links to social media sites (Facebook, Instagram, Youtube and Twitter).

In addition, the homepage contains a button embedded in the text leading directly to a description of the island and the prize.
The competition entry page contains a form with text inputs for first name, last name and email, a submit button and a radio form about where the user may have discovered the site.
There are a number of images on all three pages, showing the beauty of the island in question. 


# UX/UI


## Site Goals:

The goal of the site is to tempt a large amount of traffic by offering a huge prize, At the same time, the site aims at providing information abaout the island and the surrounding region, possibly encouraging people to visit the area in future. 

### Design Choices

With my limited ecperience, I chose a simple, clean design structure. The header and footer both have a pale yellow background, which complements the Aeolian island picture on each page. Using flex displays allowed me to keep everything neatly spaced throughout the project. 

#### User Stories
- People will obviously want to win the main "prize" of an island.
-Users should also be curious about the island itself and the region it is in.
