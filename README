{See homepage screenshot here} (assets/readme-images/Serial Winners Homepage Top.png)


## Features:

The site consists of three pages. All three pages contain the same header and footer, listing the name of the business, three menu buttons and links to social media sites (Facebook, Instagram, Youtube and Twitter).

In addition, the homepage contains a button embedded in the text leading directly to a description of the island and the prize.
The competition entry page contains a form with text inputs for first name, last name and email, a submit button and a radio form about where the user may have discovered the site.
There are a number of images on all three pages, showing the beauty of the island in question. 
All three pages were created for three different screen sizes. 


# UX/UI


## Site Goals:

The goal of the site is to tempt a large amount of traffic by offering a huge prize, At the same time, the site aims at providing information abaout the island and the surrounding region, possibly encouraging people to visit the area in future. 

### Design Choices

With my limited ecperience, I chose a simple, clean design structure. The header and footer both have a pale yellow background, which complements the Aeolian island picture on each page. Using flex displays allowed me to keep everything neatly spaced throughout the project. 

#### User Stories
- People will obviously want to win the main "prize" of an island.
-Users should also be curious about the island itself and the region it is in.

Bugs:

I spent a long time trying to resize the images and paragraphs as the pages shrunk for use with smaller screens. I'm not sure if I have suceeded 100% with my methodology but i tried my best!

##### Deployment 

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy were as follows:
Open the settings tab.
Select the main branch from the source section
The page then refreshes with a link to a website, indicating a successfull deployment. 
The link to the site is :https://townsend75.github.io/Win-an-island/


##### Sources

Content:
I referenced the code used in all of the teaching videos to some extent, particularly when creating the form element. The menu navigation is based on the love-running project. 
The factual information on the island was gleaned from Wikipedia pages about Filicudi and also the Aeolian islands. 
The photos were taken from from two different sources. One from google images and the rest from istockphotos.com
The links to social media include icons taken from fontawesome.com, as was described in the love-running tutorial.


###### Future Features and considerations
Were I to build a real competition website, I am aware that there would have to be a separate page listing the terms and conditions of the competition as well as all the legal necessities. 
I would also include more links to information about the area, including links to hotel websites, travel information and things to do in the area. 
As I progress, I would like to use more radical styling, e.g. I would like to have had small boat icons instead of buttons for the nav menu.
