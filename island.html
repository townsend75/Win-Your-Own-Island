            <h2> Filicudi- An Italian Island Paradise</h2>

            <p> Filicudi, one of seven volcanic islands making up the Aeolian Archipelago, lies just 35 miles northeast
                of Sicily, Southern Italy. Said to be named after Aeolus, the mythical ruler of the winds, 75% of hte
                island is now a natural reserve, growing wine, olive oil, grain and vegetables</p>

            <h2> Cosa Nostra?</h2>
            <p> In 1971, Filicudi was used by Italian police to exile 18 allegad Mafia bosses. Within five days, the
                entire population of 270 had left in protest. Now, around 200 people call the island home- and we think
                you should let them stay if you win!!</p>
